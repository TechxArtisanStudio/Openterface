It\u2019s been a while since our last update. I wish I could say everything\u2019s been smooth sailing for Openterface, but we\u2019ve hit a couple of speed bumps that will delay our delivery timeline. While this wasn\u2019t what we expected, we\u2019re tackling these challenges head-on and making steady progress with plenty of good news to share. This post is about a 7-minute read, so let\u2019s dive into the details so you know exactly where things stand and what\u2019s coming next.</p>"},{"location":"blog/overcoming-hurdles-progress-update--new-timeline/#regulation-production-and-quality","title":"Regulation, Production, and Quality","text":"<p>Before we could kick off production, we had to pass necessary quality tests according to regulations, particularly CE certification. Since our toolkit version includes not just the Mini-KVM but also several accessories, each part needed to undergo CE testing. These tests took longer than expected (turns out cables can be quite picky), but the great news is that we\u2019ve passed CE for our Mini-KVM and all its components! Below is an overview of the certifications for all our parts: Mini-KVM, HDMI cable, orange Type-C cable, black short Type-C cable, and VGA2HDMI cable. With certification in hand, our production timeline is now certain, and our manufacturers are currently producing all parts as I speak.</p> <p> UKCA and CE requirements are the same for our electronic products, with CE also covering RoHS compliance.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, we visited one of our manufacturers to train their line managers on quality control for the orange cables before they shipped them to us. Now, ALL the orange cables have been produced and are sitting in a corner of our studio.  Kevin and Shawn were explaining the testing methods to ensure the orange cable works properly with our Openterface Mini-KVM.</p> <p>We will do the same task in this week to train QA at the production frontline for other parts as well. Here are samples of additional cables.  Proudly marked with our TechxArtisan logo, these are samples of the HDMI cable, the short Type-C cable, and the VGA-to-HDMI cable.</p> <p>We\u2019re expecting the other parts and Mini-KVMs to arrive soon from our manufacturers, at which point we\u2019ll double-check the quality of every component and pack them properly at our studio before shipment. In other words, our team will personally ensure the quality before it reaches your hands.</p>"},{"location":"blog/overcoming-hurdles-progress-update--new-timeline/#shipment-potential-delays-and-new-eta","title":"Shipment, Potential Delays, and New ETA","text":"<p>The current uncertainty lies in the shipment process. After investigating several shipping companies, we found that shipping will take extra time as we will likely transfer parcels through a warehouse before reaching Crowd Supply\u2019s warehouse. We\u2019re still debating whether to choose sea or air freight\u2014please bear with us for a few more days while we sort out the arrangements.</p> <p>Customs clearance is another potential hurdle that might cause unexpected delays. Once our products arrive at Crowd Supply's warehouse in the US, they\u2019ll take one to two weeks to ship out globally based on each order. For backers outside the US, individual parcels will still need to go through global shipping and customs clearance in the destination country.</p> <p>Accounting for the current situation and adding some buffer time, I remain cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ll complete delivery before the end of this year, with a new ETA of mid-January. I\u2019m truly sorry for the inconvenience and appreciate your support and patience during this change.</p>"},{"location":"blog/overcoming-hurdles-progress-update--new-timeline/#finalised-hardware-v19","title":"Finalised Hardware V1.9","text":"<p>As you may know from our previous Reddit post, we decided to upgrade our hardware to V1.9, including a set of hackable expansion pins. This wasn\u2019t part of the original plan for the crowdfunding campaign, but we believe it significantly enhances the hardware\u2019s potential for broader use.</p> <p> The VCC, GND, Target D+, Target D-, Host D+, and Host D- pins\u2014where \u2018D\u2019 stands for USB data.</p> <p>One key motivation was to enable the USB switch to be toggled at the software level. Why is this important? On our roadmap, we aim to support a KVM-over-IP solution, such as VNC, in the future. The idea is to match local KVM control with the VNC protocol, allowing users to remotely control the target computer via the host computer. In such a remote scenario, the ability for users to switch the USB port is essential, especially when file transfers between the host and target are required.</p> <p>The expansion pins also open up possibilities for more, like integrating with iPadOS, ATX control, network bridging, and audio bypass. While I won\u2019t dive into all the details here, I encourage you to join our Openterface community to discuss with us further.</p> <p>This hardware upgrade could potentially extend our Openterface solution to operate over IP and include more advanced features while still maintaining its core strength as a plug-and-play KVM-over-USB tool\u2014perfect for IT pros navigating uncertain IT environments, like unfamiliar data centres.</p> <p>I\u2019m happy to report that V1.9 has passed our internal basic tests and will be finalised as the official version for all our backers. However, this hardware upgrade will require further testing, and any development based on these expansion pins will be experimental and likely to have bugs. This is where you can contribute. We\u2019re counting on the open-source community to help us improve Openterface together.</p>"},{"location":"blog/overcoming-hurdles-progress-update--new-timeline/#more-software-updates","title":"More Software Updates","text":"<p>On the software front, we\u2019re making exciting strides.

Please check USB Port Switching Guide for more.</p> <p>USB power limitations</p> <p>The power supplied by the USB port depends on the Host motherboard. It is not recommended to connect USB devices that require a lot of power. Typically, the power consumption should not exceed 1.5W. Connecting high-power devices may result in unstable operation or potential damage.</p> <p>USB-A Port Has Firm Locking Mechanism</p> <p>The USB-A port includes a locking mechanism that requires extra force when plugging in or removing devices. This is intentional and ensures a secure connection. Avoid using very small USB devices (like ultra-compact USB drives), as they may be difficult to grip and remove, potentially leading to damage.</p> <p>Extra USB Hub Requires External Power and May Affect Compatibility</p> <p>The mini-KVM already includes a built-in USB hub that connects to both the host and the target computer. If you connect an additional external USB hub to the USB-A port, any USB devices attached to it will operate at a deeper level in the USB device tree. Some computers may have limitations on USB tree depth, which can cause compatibility issues or prevent certain devices from working correctly.</p> <p>Additionally, make sure any connected USB hub is externally powered. Unpowered hubs may cause instability or malfunction of the entire mini-KVM setup.</p> <p>\u2464   - Toggle Switch: For toggling the connection of the USB-A 2.0 port between the host and the target computer</p> <p>\u2465   - Extension Pins: Hidden by default and only accessible by replacing the top cover with an alternate cap.
