# KVM-over-USB Basics

### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } What is KVM-over-USB? {: #what-is-kvm-over-usb }

A **USB KVM**‚Äîoften referred to as **KVM-over-USB**‚Äîis a keyboard, video, and mouse control solution that connects directly to a headless or unattended computer via USB and typically an HDMI (or similar, such as VGA or Micro HDMI) video interface. Its plug-and-play design eliminates the need for complex network configurations, making it ideal for IT professionals, system builders, and enthusiasts who need reliable, portable, and immediate access‚Äîeven where network connectivity is limited or unavailable.

1. **Screen Streaming**  
   It captures the target device's display (via HDMI) and shows it in an application window on your host computer.

2. **Mouse & Cursor Control**  
   Moving your mouse into the [host app](/app) window on your host computer instantly translates into mouse movements on the target device, similar to a VNC experience.

3. **Keyboard Input**  
   Keystrokes you type on your host keyboard are sent to the target computer when the app is active.

4. **HID Signal Conversion**  
   All keyboard and mouse inputs are converted into standard HID signals recognizable by the target device, ensuring seamless compatibility.

5. **Synchronization**  
   The app keeps the target computer's display and controls perfectly in sync with your host, allowing you to interact with both systems on a single screen.

### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } What are the benefits of USB KVM? {: #why-usb-kvm }

USB KVMs are designed for:

-   **Simple & Fast Setup**: Connect USB and HDMI cables‚Äîno extra drivers or network needed.
-   **Network Independence**: Works flawlessly without LAN or internet, avoiding network instability.
-   **Stable Control**: Offers consistent, high-quality (Full HD or 4K) video with low latency.
-   **Emulated Keyboard & Mouse**: Uses standard HID signals, ensuring broad OS compatibility.
-   **BIOS-Level Access**: Lets you adjust firmware or startup settings right from power-on.
-   **Simplicity & Portability**: Compact, low-power design that's easy to carry.
-   **Direct File Transfer**: Quickly share files via a switchable USB-A port.
-   **[Use Cases](/use-cases)**: Perfect for headless systems, onsite troubleshooting, and BIOS/OS-level fixes.

Compared to network-dependent solutions, USB KVMs allow IT professionals and tech enthusiasts to rapidly configure and troubleshoot devices in scenarios where reliability and offline accessibility are crucial.
