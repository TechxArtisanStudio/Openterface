### :fontawesome-solid-book: Switchable USB Port and File Transfer

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can the Mini-KVM support file transfers? {: #file-transfer }

Yes, the Openterface Mini-KVM includes [a switchable USB-A port](/product/minikvm/usb-switch) shared between the host and target devices.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can the switchable USB-A port be toggled in software? {: #usb-port-toggle }

With the hardware upgrade to v1.9, yes! It supports both physical flipping and toggling at the software level.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Why USB 2.0 instead of USB 3.0? {: #usb-2-vs-3 }

USB 2.0 is fully capable of handling video capture at 1080p@30Hz, transmitting HID signals (for keyboard and mouse), and managing standard-speed file transfers between the target and host computers. This makes our product a speedy, lightweight, and portable solution, exactly as designed.

Using USB 3.0 would make the PCB design much more complex and significantly increase production costs. Additionally, while USB 3.0 does offer faster file transfers, it also generates more heat, which could shorten the lifespan of the device.

We are considering the application of USB 3.0 for the next version, targeting more professional use scenarios and stationary KVM solutions.

---

### :fontawesome-solid-book: Technical

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Is the Mini-KVM open-source? {: #mini-kvm-open-source }

Yes! The Openterface Mini-KVM is fully open-sourced in both [hardware](/how-it-works/#explore-hardware-details) and [software](/quick-start/#install-host-application), certified by [OSHWA](https://certification.oshwa.org/cn000015.html), and supported by [a vibrant community](/community/). If you are interested in [contributing](/contributing/), please contact us at info@openterface.com. Stay tuned!

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can I access a device's BIOS settings? {: #bios-access }

Yes, the direct connection of the Openterface Mini-KVM enables access to low-level BIOS or firmware settings.

This feature stands in contrast to software-based KVM solutions or remote control applications like TeamViewer and VNC, which are typically not capable of BIOS-level interactions.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Why doesn't the keyboard control work at the BIOS level for some older target computers?

It seems that some old computers' BIOS can't recognize our device's USB hub, which can cause issues with our emulated keyboard and mouse not working properly at the BIOS level. We're keeping an eye on this problem.

We've had a report that on one specific HP computer, the HP Engage Flex Pro, the keyboard doesn't work at the BIOS screen, though it functions normally once the operating system boots up.

If you encounter the same issue, please report it to us via a GitHub issue.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } How is video/data transmitted? {: #video-data-transmission }

Video data is captured via HDMI and transmitted over USB 2.0 to the host computer for display. The switchable USB 2.0 port allows USB drive or other USB device sharing between the target and the host.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } How does the Mini-KVM handle power? {: #mini-kvm-power }

The device does not require an external power supply, as it is designed to be powered through its USB Type-C connections from the host, enhancing its portability. In scenarios where the target device is a low-power micro-computer, such as a Raspberry Pi, it could be powered through the host via the Mini-KVM's switchable USB port. However, this is not recommended. The standard method of operation is to have an external power supply to the target device.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can I DIY this device?

Absolutely! We're a bunch of passionate makers who love to DIY, and we are making sure this project is open source in both hardware and software. You can technically build it from scratch. We're even thinking about posting a guide on how to DIY a breadboard version of our product that would also be compatible with our software.

Our community is already experimenting with different hardware versions. Check out our community posts to learn more, share your own DIY experiences, or even join our [USB DIY Contest](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/usb-kvm-diy-challenge-2024), co-hosted with Crowd Supply! Plus, you might find that with a few tweaks to the code, our software could work seamlessly with your creative DIY setup!

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can I use a longer orange USB-C cable for the host connection? {: #orange-cable-length }

We don’t recommend using a **USB-C host cable longer than 1.5 meters** (the orange one) due to signal and power stability issues.

If you **must** use a longer host cable, you'll need to **inject additional power** to maintain reliable performance. Here are three supported methods:

1. **USB-A Power Injection**  
   Plug a **USB-A male to male cable** into the Mini-KVM’s [**Switchable USB-A port**](/product/minikvm/usb-switch/) to provide 5V power.

2. **Power via Extension Pin**  
   Use the hidden [extension pin](/product/minikvm/extension-pins/) (under the protective cap) to directly supply power.

3. **Type-C Power Splitter**  
   Use a **USB-C Y-splitter** (1 male to 2 female) between the cable and the Mini-KVM. One leg connects to your host computer, the other to a power source.

Why does this matter?

From our testing, longer host-side cables (over 1.5m) can cause voltage drop and signal degradation, especially with high data rates like video transmission. That’s why our included orange cable is short and power-efficient by design.

✅ **Target side note**: The same applies to the **black USB cable** (target side). Try to keep it under 1.5 meters too — the Mini-KVM can draw power from either side, and stability depends on cable quality and length.

### :fontawesome-solid-book: Control Mechanism

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Will there be a version with wireless or Ethernet connectivity? {: #wireless-version }

Currently, we're not planning to add wireless or Ethernet connectivity to our Openterface products. We're focused on providing fast, stable control over USB directly to your target device, so you don't have to worry about network issues.

But hey, we're always open to feedback! If you think there's a real need for this feature, or if you're struggling to find a good KVM-over-IP solution, drop us an email: info@openterface.com. And remember, if we decide to expand our connectivity options, our [community](/community) will be the first to know.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } How is this different from other KVM solutions? {: #mini-kvm-vs-other-kvms }

Curious about how the Openterface Mini-KVM stacks up against other solutions? Check out our detailed [Comparison](/faq/usbkvm/openterface/#comparison-openterface-mini-kvm-vs-other-kvm-solutions) page.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Does it work with a PS/2 computer? {: #ps2-compatibility }

No. We are aware that there are still many old headless computers out there that require PS/2 keyboards and mice. As far as we know, there isn't yet an elegant solution for converting USB HID signals to split into PS/2 keyboard and mouse signals. We are still investigating this matter and considering how to support PS/2 in future versions of the Mini-KVM. If you know of any solutions that could elegantly work with our Mini-KVM, please share them with us. Thank you!

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can I use multiple Mini-KVMs with one master computer? {: #multiple-mini-kvm }

Yes, you can! Our Mini-KVM can technically handle this, but we're still tweaking the code and running tests. We're focusing on making sure that our software can automatically link up the keyboard and mouse with the right video source when you use more than one Mini-KVM at a time. Also, we're sprucing up the software's UI to make it better for this kind of setup. Stay tuned to our community updates for when we roll out this feature!

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can it power on/off the connected computer? {: #power-control }

Not directly — MiniKVM doesn’t have built-in ATX power control. However, it *does* include [extension pins](/product/minikvm/extension-pins/) that open up the possibility for an add-on module to handle ATX power switching.  

While our dev team hasn’t prioritized this hardware expansion yet, it’s definitely on our radar. If you're into hardware development and would like to contribute or prototype an ATX extension, we’d love to hear from you! Join the community and help shape what’s next.

### :fontawesome-solid-book: Video Related

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } What about video latency and resolution? {: #video-latency-resolution }

Our device handles 1080p video output with under 140 milliseconds of latency, making your control experience smooth and seamless. Check out its [specifications](/product/minikvm/specifications/).

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } What are the supported input and output video resolutions of the Openterface Mini-KVM? {: #video-resolution-guide }

The Openterface Mini-KVM supports a wide range of video input resolutions, including up to **4K (4096 x 2160 @ 30Hz)**. However, its **effective capture resolution** — the resolution actually processed and displayed on your host computer — is **1920x1080**. Resolutions above that will be downsampled, which may introduce slight visual blur due to pixel merging.

??? info "Key Definitions: Input Resolution & Effective Max Capture"
    - **Input Resolution**: The resolution output by your target computer.
    - **Capture Resolution**: The resolution at which the Mini-KVM captures and transmits video to the host computer.  
    - **Effective Max Capture**: 1920x1080 — for the best clarity and performance.

??? info "Supported Input Resolutions"
    The Mini-KVM can accept and process common standard resolutions, including but not limited to:

    -   4096 x 2160 @ 30Hz, 29.97Hz (Highest resolution supported by the Openterface Mini-KVM)
    -   3840 x 2160 @ 30Hz, 29.97Hz (4k resolution with 16:9 aspect ratio)
    -   2100 x 1050 @ 60Hz (optimized for mobile devices with 16:9 aspect ratio)
    -   1920 x 1200 @ 60Hz (16:10 aspect ratio)
    -   1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz (The best display resolution with 16:9 aspect ratio)
    -   1680 x 1050 @ 60Hz (16:9 aspect ratio)
    -   1600 x 900 @ 60Hz (16:9 aspect ratio)
    -   1440 x 900 @ 60Hz (16:9 aspect ratio)
    -   1280 x 1024 @ 60Hz (5:4 aspect ratio)
    -   1280 x 960 @ 60Hz (4:3 aspect ratio)
    -   1280 x 800 @ 60Hz (16:10 aspect ratio)
    -   1280 x 720 @ 60Hz (16:9 aspect ratio)
    -   1152 x 864 @ 60Hz (4:3 aspect ratio)

    -   640 x 480 @ 60Hz (Optimized for old CRT monitors resolution with 4:3 aspect ratio)

???+ tip "Best Practice"
    Set both the target output and the Mini-KVM capture resolution to **1920x1080** for optimal sharpness and minimal latency.

**What happens with target output resolutions above 1080p?**

If your target computer outputs at a higher resolution than 1080p, the Mini-KVM will **merge multiple pixels** into one for display on the host. This may make the image appear **blurry**.

???+ info "Improving Blurry Image"
    You can improve visual clarity on the host side by **scaling up the display**. While this won’t restore full detail, it smooths the output and enhances visibility.

**Troubleshooting Glitches**

If you're seeing video glitches or no signal after changing resolution or refresh rate:

1. In the host app, **lower the capture resolution** temporarily to **640x480 @ 30Hz**.
2. On the target device, **revert to a supported standard resolution** (like 1080p).
3. Switch back to your desired resolution in the host app once stability returns.

???+ warning "Avoid Non-Standard Settings"
    Non-standard resolutions or refresh rates above **60Hz** may exceed the Mini-KVM’s stable operating limits and cause glitching or instability.

##### Summary Tips

- **Best clarity**: 1920x1080 input + 1920x1080 capture
- **Avoid blur**: Try not to exceed the 1080p capture limit
- **Scaling helps**: Increase display scale on host side if using 4K input
- **Troubleshoot with low resolution**: Use 640x480 @ 30Hz as a fallback

By understanding how input and capture resolutions interact, you can optimize your setup for smooth, high-quality remote control with the Openterface Mini-KVM.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Is it suitable for gaming? {: #gaming-compatibility }

The current design is geared toward technical and IT operations — it’s built for reliable device control, configuration, and troubleshooting rather than high-resolution or latency-sensitive gaming.

That said, some of our more playful and curious users have already tested it with lighter games like Minecraft or emulators, and it works just fine for those! So while it’s not designed for AAA gaming, casual or retro-style games are definitely doable.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Will future versions support higher-quality displays? {: #future-display-support }

We know a lot of you are looking for top-notch display features. While it's not our main focus right now, based on your feedback, we're considering adding enhanced display capabilities in a professional version of the Openterface Mini-KVM.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Why doesn't it stream video over local IP? {: #no-ip-streaming }

The Openterface Mini-KVM is designed for stable, low-latency control via direct HDMI and USB connections. While it's technically possible to stream video over a local network, our current focus is on reliability through wired connections. That said, we are exploring features like VLC or even VNC integration in our host apps for future releases.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } How about KVM control over the internet? {: #no-internet-control }

As for streaming over the internet, that’s a whole different challenge — it involves hosting remote services, handling security, and rethinking parts of our business model. It’s not off the table, but it’s a big step.

That said, since our Mini-KVM relies on your host computer, you can already pair it with existing remote desktop tools to control your target computer remotely.

We’re always open to ideas — if you have thoughts on how you'd like remote streaming to work, feel free to email us or join the conversation in the community!

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can it work with VGA, DVI, DisplayPort, etc.? {: #video-output-support }

Sort of. The Openterface Mini-KVM captures video through an HDMI port. However, you can use various video adapters like [VGA-to-HDMI](/use-cases/#streamlined-server-management), [DVI-to-HDMI](/use-cases/#unified-control-for-diverse-devices), [miniHDMI-to-HDMI](/use-cases/#simplified-setup-for-tech-enthusiasts), or DP-to-HDMI, to connect different video sources.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Will there be a video recording feature for troubleshooting? {: #video-recording-feature }

Yes! We're developing a "dashcam-style" continuous recording feature that will:

-   Capture short video segments of the target computer
-   Allow frame-by-frame review of critical moments (like fast-disappearing error messages)
-   Support at least 30fps for clear analysis of rapid events (e.g., kernel panics during boot)

This will be particularly valuable for debugging scenarios where:

-   Error messages flash too quickly to read
-   Systems crash during early boot sequences
-   You need forensic analysis of console output

The feature is currently on our development roadmap - stay tuned for updates!

### :fontawesome-solid-book: Troubleshooting

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Why does it sometimes have issues with USB hubs? {: #usb-hub-issues }

When a USB hub is used on the target side, the Openterface Mini-KVM might become unstable. This is because the Openterface Mini-KVM relies primarily on the target port for power. If the USB hub connected to the target is fully loaded, it may cause a significant voltage drop, leading to instability in the Openterface Mini-KVM due to insufficient power. If you need to use a USB hub on the target side, consider using a powered USB hub with an external power supply to ensure stable operation.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } What if the app doesn't display the target screen or input is unresponsive? {: #unstable-issues }

If you encounter instability with the Openterface Mini-KVM—such as the app not displaying the target's screen or the inability to control the mouse and keyboard—try disconnecting all the cables. After a brief moment, reconnect the cables and try again. This simple reset often resolves connection issues.

---

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } My host app or system shows absurd resolutions like 43184x24228@44Hz, and there's no video. What should I do?

This symptom often points to a firmware issue on the capture chip. On Windows, open “USB Tree Viewer” and confirm you see “**MACROSILION Openterface USB Composite Device**” instead of just “MACROSILION USB Composite Device.” On Linux/macOS, check `lsusb -v` output for “Openterface.” If the capture firmware has reverted to factory default, **re-flash** the Openterface firmware (available on our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/TechxArtisanStudio/Openterface_QT/releases)). If that doesn’t fix the issue, please reach out to our support team.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } I re-flashed the capture firmware, but I still can’t get normal video capture. What else can I try?  {: #firmware-reflash-issue }

1. Double-check that your device enumerates correctly in a Windows environment with “USB Tree Viewer” or via `lsusb -v` on Linux.
2. Confirm that your host app is the latest official release.
3. If you continue to see no improvement—or bizarre resolutions and no display—contact our support. We’ll work with you on additional diagnostics and, if needed, arrange a replacement.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } Why is my screen completely black when using a VGA-to-HDMI cable or adapter?  {: #vga-black-screen }
Our [VGA-to-HDMI converter cable](/product/accessories/vga-to-hdmi-cable/) **needs extra power** to function. If you see only a black screen, you might be missing a power connection. (1)

??? info "Steps to make the VGA-to-HDMI cable work"

    1. **Connect the USB Power**  
    - Our VGA-to-HDMI cables include a USB plug that must be connected to a powered USB port (either on the Mini-KVM’s [switchable USB port](/product/minikvm/usb-switch/) or the target computer). This powers the VGA-to-HDMI conversion chip.

    2. **Confirm Resolution**  
    - Make sure the target computer is using a supported resolution, such as 1280x1024 or 1024x768 at 60Hz.  
    - Resolutions outside the supported range can produce a black or distorted screen.

    3. **Try Another Adapter**  
    - If possible, test with a different VGA-to-HDMI adapter or cable. Some converters lack proper power draw and can cause blank screens.

    Still no luck? Snap a photo of your setup (including cables) and send it to our support team. We’ll help you troubleshoot or arrange a replacement if necessary.

#### :material-chat-question:{ .faq } How does it integrate with AI? {: #ai-integration }

Our long-term vision is for Openterface Mini-KVM to serve as the physical interface layer between AI agents and real-world computers. Inspired by early projects like [OthersideAI’s self-operating computer](https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer), and now further validated by recent breakthroughs like [Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 models](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use), this vision is quickly becoming more tangible.

Mini-KVM acts as the “eyes” and “hands” — capturing real-time video from a target machine and enabling keyboard/mouse input via USB. Combined with a capable host computer running an AI agent, this setup could allow LLMs to observe, interpret, and operate full desktops — even across platforms — without needing any software installed on the target machine.

We’re still in the early stages of this integration, but the possibilities are expanding fast. If you’re experimenting with AI agents and want to explore this space together, we’d love to hear from you!
