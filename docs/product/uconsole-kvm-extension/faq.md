## Installation & Hardware

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } How does the KVM Extension Board work?**

It captures HDMI output from a target device and displays it on the uConsole. At the same time, the uConsole's keyboard and trackball are used to control the target device via USB HID emulation.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can I use this with the 4G/LTE module installed?**

No. This board occupies the same expansion slot. You'll need to choose between cellular connectivity or KVM functionality.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Why do I need the washers?**

The KVM Extension board is 1.0mm thick (thinner than the original 4G/LTE 1.2mm). The washers compensates for this difference and ensures proper spring contactor pressure for reliable connections.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } What tools do I need for installation?**

You'll need a hex screwdriver to remove and install the mounting screws. ESD precautions (wrist strap or grounded surface) are recommended but not required.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Is the installation reversible?**

Yes, you can remove the KVM Extension board and reinstall the original 4G/LTE module at any time. Keep the original module and screws in a safe place.

---

## Compatibility

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Which uConsole models are compatible?**

Compatible with uConsole devices that feature the standard 4G/LTE expansion slot. Check your device specifications to confirm compatibility.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } What target devices can I control?**

Any device with HDMI output, including:

- Desktop computers and servers
- Single-board computers (Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- Embedded systems
- Industrial PCs
- Gaming consoles
- Media players

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Does the target device need special software?**

No software installation is required on the target device. The KVM Extension works with any device that has HDMI output.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can I control multiple target devices?**

You can control one target device at a time. To switch between devices, disconnect the HDMI cable and connect it to a different target device.

## Control & Features

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } What input methods are supported?**

- Full keyboard emulation including multimedia keys
- Absolute and relative mouse positioning
- Computer wake-up function
- Audio passthrough via HDMI

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can I transfer files between uConsole and target device?**

The KVM Extension provides video and input control only. For file transfer, you'll need to use other methods like network sharing, USB drives, or cloud storage.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Does it support BIOS-level access?**

Yes, direct USB HID emulation allows full BIOS-level control, unlike network-based remote access tools.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can I use it for gaming?**

While technically possible, the latency and control method may not be ideal for fast-paced gaming. It's better suited for system administration and development tasks.

## Video & Audio

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } What video resolutions are supported?**

The extension accepts standard HDMI video input. The actual display resolution depends on your uConsole's screen capabilities.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Is audio supported?**

Yes, HDMI embedded audio is passed through to the uConsole's speakers.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } What about video latency?**

The extension provides low-latency video suitable for real-time interaction and BIOS-level troubleshooting.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Can I use adapters for different video outputs?**

Yes, you can use HDMI adapters for devices with VGA, DVI, or DisplayPort outputs.
