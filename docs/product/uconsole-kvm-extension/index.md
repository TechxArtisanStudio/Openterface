## FAQs

**Q: How does the KVM Extension Board work?**  
It captures HDMI output from a target device and displays it on the uConsole. At the same time, the uConsole‚Äôs keyboard and trackball are used to control the target device via USB HID emulation.

**Q: Can I use this with the 4G/LTE module installed?**  
No ‚Äì this board occupies the same expansion slot. You‚Äôll need to choose between cellular connectivity or KVM functionality.

**Q: Is the software open source?**  
Yes! Firmware, drivers, and installation tools are fully open-source and available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openterface).
