## Hardware Installation

Follow these hardware installation steps to replace the 4G/LTE module in your uConsole with the Openterface KVM Extension board and ensure a secure fit.

### What You‚Äôll Need

- Your Openterface KVM extension board
- The provided gasket (plastic shim) 
- A Hex screwdriver (for the board‚Äôs mounting screws)
- ESD precautions (wrist strap or grounded surface) ‚Äî recommended

### Installing the Extension Board

1. Power Off and Disconnect

    Shut down the uConsole and disconnect all power and cables.

2. Remove the Existing Module

    Use a hex screwdriver to remove the two screws holding the 4G/LTE module or existing extension board.

    Carefully lift the board straight up to avoid bending the spring contactors.

3. Install the KVM Extension Board

    - The Openterface KVM Extension board is 1.0 mm thick (thinner than the original 4G/LTE 1.2 mm). Because of this, we recommend placing the provided gasket on the screw posts (between the PCB and the mounting standoffs) so the gasket sits under the screw posts before seating the board. This compensates for the thinner PCB and helps ensure proper spring contactor pressure.
    - If you prefer to check first, seat the board without the gasket and verify even spring contact; if contact is uneven or the board sits loosely, add the gasket and reseat the board.

4. Reinsert Screws

    Reinsert the two screws and tighten with the hex screwdriver. Snug is sufficient ‚Äî do not overtighten.

5. Verify Fit

    The board should sit flat with no noticeable movement. Verify spring contactors are making even contact across the pads.

6. Test the Hardware

    Reconnect power, boot the system, and test HDMI, audio, and USB HID devices to confirm proper operation.

## FAQs

**Q: How does the KVM Extension Board work?**  
It captures HDMI output from a target device and displays it on the uConsole. At the same time, the uConsole‚Äôs keyboard and trackball are used to control the target device via USB HID emulation.

**Q: Can I use this with the 4G/LTE module installed?**  
No. This board occupies the same expansion slot. You‚Äôll need to choose between cellular connectivity or KVM functionality.

**Q: Is the software open source?**  
Yes! Our **Openterface Connect** Apps are fully open-source and available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TechxArtisanStudio/Openterface_QT).
