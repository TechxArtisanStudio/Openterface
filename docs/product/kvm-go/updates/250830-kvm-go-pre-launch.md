# Join the KVM-Go Beta Test Team – Freebit & Limited Spots Available!

We are thrilled to share the **pre-launch** of **KVM-Go**, the ultra-portable next chapter of our KVM-over-USB solution. This is our very first update for the project!

![alt text](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQG4GAKh4OFQJQ/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B56ZmENNSfG0AI-/0/1758859682191?e=1761782400&v=beta&t=mMtazsJHIO6HLJaEiIcOFQtRiZ5mgEB0JgPCAinTxuQ)

As we move into **small-batch production** this September, we will produce three versions in sequence: **HDMI**, **DisplayPort**, and **VGA**. Each batch will go through careful testing before we scale up production.

### Be part of our exclusive beta programme

We are inviting a small group of passionate users to **beta test KVM-Go** before the full launch of our crowdfunding campaign.

Spots are extremely limited, so we cannot accommodate everyone. If you have **unique use cases, creative ideas, or testing experience** that could help us refine KVM-Go’s reliability and usability, we would love to hear from you. Please share your thoughts and apply through this brief form:  
[**Google Form link**](https://forms.gle/yaS1F5E5MSo8DWNZ6)

If you have already submitted the form, thank you! While I may not be able to reply individually, please know that I personally read every comment and suggestion. **I hear you!** If you are selected, I will reach out to you directly by email.

### Help us grow the community

Your support makes open hardware possible. Please **spread the word** about KVM-Go, especially if you have already experienced the magic of Openterface in your tech workflows.

Share the pre-launch page on your social media and use tags like **#Openterface #KVMGO #CrowdSupply #TinyKVM #Crowdfunding #OpenHardware** to help us reach more like-minded tech enthusiasts.

The more people who join and share, the stronger our community becomes, and the closer we get to delivering KVM-Go at an accessible price point.

**Thank you** for being part of this journey. Together, we can make KVM-Go a tool that empowers sysadmins, IT pros, and makers everywhere.
