# New Demo Video, Software Progress, and What's Inside KVM-GO

Hey everyone! Sorry for the quiet period. We’ve been heads down polishing both hardware and software for [KVM-GO](https://openterface.com/product/kvm-go/), and time flew by. As of late December, we’ve reached **$72k with 220+ backers**, which is amazing. If you can help us push it further, please **spread the word**!

Thanks so much for your patience and support. And yes, Christmas definitely added to the chaos 🙂🎄 Now, let’s catch up.

## New Demo Video: KVM-GO in Action

We’ve just published a [**new demo video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=459rWCQbJRE) showing KVM-GO in real-world use.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/459rWCQbJRE?si=6IbiJwkcpuZurepz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In the video, you’ll see:

* KVM-GO **HDMI / DP / VGA** versions in action
* What’s included **in the box**
* How to control different target devices
* How KVM-GO fits into real workflows, from quick access to multi-target setups

If you’re curious about more casual, hands-on testing and real usage, feel free to check out our [social media](https://openterface.com/about/community/) as well. We often share raw testing clips and practical scenarios showing how KVM-GO behaves on real tech frontlines.

## Software Progress: One App for Mini-KVM and KVM-GO

On the software side, we’ve made a solid step forward.

Our latest updates allow the **same Openterface application to work seamlessly with both Mini-KVM and the KVM-GO series**. For users, this means:

* A consistent experience across products
* Less fragmentation if you use more than one Openterface device

We’ve also spent time improving **keyboard and mouse performance**, with a focus on:

* Lower overall latency
* More stable input handling, including better detection of connection state and signal quality
* Snappier response during fast or continuous interactions

While gaming is not the primary target use case for our KVM solutions, we still care deeply about input responsiveness in real-world scenarios. If you’re interested in the technical details, especially on macOS, we recently published a deep dive here:
👉 **[Openterface Mini-KVM Mouse Speed & Gaming Performance on macOS](https://openterface.com/app/updates/20251218-macos-mouse-speed/)**

Many of the improvements discussed there are now feeding directly into our unified software stack for both Mini-KVM and KVM-GO.

## Core Hardware Upgrades in KVM-GO (Compared to Mini-KVM)

For those interested in the internals, here’s a quick comparison of key hardware changes from Mini-KVM to KVM-GO.

### Video Pipeline Upgrade

| Aspect           | **MS2109 (Mini-KVM)**    | **MS2130S (KVM-GO)** | Improvement           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| HDMI input       | 4K @ 30Hz                | 4K @ 60Hz            | 2× input bandwidth    |
| USB video output | 1080p @ 30Hz             | 4K @ 60Hz            | 4× pixel throughput   |
| Internal scaling | 4K → 1080p               | Native 4K            | No forced downscaling |
| Frame latency    | Higher (scaler + buffer) | Lower (direct path)  | Reduced latency       |

### USB Keyboard & Mouse Emulation Upgrade

| Aspect             | **CH340 + CH9329 (Mini-KVM)** | **CH32V208 (KVM-GO)** | Improvement     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Chip count         | 2 chips                       | Single MCU            | Simpler system  |
| USB handling       | USB–Serial bridge             | Native USB device     | Lower latency   |
| HID generation     | Fixed-function                | Firmware-defined      | Full control    |
| Data path          | USB → UART → HID              | USB → HID             | One hop removed |
| BIOS compatibility | Mixed                         | Excellent             | More reliable   |

## Advanced Features in Active Development

Several advanced features are planned and actively under development for the finalized KVM-GO firmware. A quick preview:

* **Custom EDID support** for solving display compatibility issues
* **Script-based control** for automation and advanced workflows

We’ll share more details as these features mature.

## Open-Source Commitment (As Always)

Yes, **KVM-GO will remain fully open-source**.

Once the hardware design is finalized for mass production, we will apply for **OSHWA (Open Source Hardware Association) certification**.

All hardware design files and STL models will be published here:
👉 [https://github.com/TechxArtisanStudio/Openterface_KVM-GO_Hardware](https://github.com/TechxArtisanStudio/Openterface_KVM-GO_Hardware)

Transparency and community collaboration remain core to what we do.

## Final Days of the Campaign: A Friendly Reminder

We’re now in the **final days** of the crowdfunding campaign.

Crowdfunding is the **best chance to get KVM-GO at the lowest price**. Once the campaign ends and we move to post-crowdfunding orders, the price will go up.

If you’ve been on the fence, now is the time.

👉 **Support the campaign and secure your unit on Crowd Supply:**

Thank you again for your patience, trust, and support. More updates are coming soon, and we’ll try not to go quiet again. Warm holiday wishes from all of us!
