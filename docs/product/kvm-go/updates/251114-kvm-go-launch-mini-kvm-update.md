# 🚀 Exciting News: KVM-GO is Now Live!

**Hey there, Openterface Mini-KVM community!**

We have some exciting news to share with you! Our next-generation device, [**Openterface KVM-GO**](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/openterface-kvm-go), is now officially live on Crowd Supply and accepting backers!

## What is KVM-GO?

Building on the success of our flagship **Mini-KVM** and the vibrant growth of our open-source community, **KVM-GO** pushes portability even further. While Mini-KVM continues to shine as the flexible all-rounder, KVM-GO is crafted for those who demand maximum convenience in the smallest possible form factor.

### Key Features of KVM-GO:

* **Keychain-ready, video-cable-free design** – Built-in video connectors (HDMI, DisplayPort, or VGA) mean no more rummaging for video cables during urgent server rack interventions. Just plug in and go.

* **Compact yet powerful** – Despite its tiny form factor, KVM-GO packs impressive specs:
  * **4K @ 60 Hz video output** support (compared to Mini-KVM's 1080p @ 30 Hz)
  * HDMI and DisplayPort models feature **USB 3.0** video processor for high performance
  * Convenient **micro SD slot** for file transfers or bootable OS installation

* **Cross-platform support** – Just like Mini-KVM, KVM-GO works seamlessly across **Windows, macOS, Linux**, **Android**, **iPadOS**, and **Web App**.

* **Open source ethos** – Fully open hardware with open-source software, maintaining the same commitment to open-source principles that made Mini-KVM possible.

* **Zero setup on target devices** – No drivers, no installation, just pure plug-and-play functionality.

## Mini-KVM vs. KVM-GO: Which One is Right for You?

Both devices share the same open-source software and core philosophy, but serve different needs:

* **Mini-KVM** – The flexible all-rounder, perfect for versatile setups and those who need the proven reliability of our flagship device.

* **KVM-GO** – The ultra-portable option, ideal for maximum convenience, keychain-ready portability, and higher video resolution needs.

Both are excellent choices, and your support for either (or both!) helps push KVM-over-USB open-source technology forward!
