# 🚀 KVM-Go HDMI Beta Batch Rolling Out!

![kvm-go-beta-test-1](https://assets.openterface.com/images/kvm-go/beta-test/1.webp){:style="max-width:720px"}

Big thanks to everyone who signed up to join our **KVM-GO beta team**. We've just packed and shipped the first small batch of beta devices! 🎉

It’s been quite a ride getting this compact little KVM to work the way we imagined, ultra-portable yet powerful enough to handle serious workflows. We’ve hit some tough challenges along the way (heat issues are real when you’re pushing higher resolutions in such a tiny body), but we’re on it and learning fast with your help.

We truly appreciate everyone supporting our open-source hardware and software journey. 🙏 This project wouldn’t be possible without the community testing, sharing feedback, and spreading the word.

More rounds of beta testing are coming, though spots are limited. If you’re a maker, sysadmin, or IT tinkerer who loves pushing devices to their edge, keep an eye out, we’ll need your help to shape the next iterations.
