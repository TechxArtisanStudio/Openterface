# KVM-GO Production Progress #1

### HDMI / VGA Finalized, DP in Final Fit Optimization

Hey everyone 👏 Quick production update to keep things clear and grounded.

KVM-GO is in a **healthy and steady stage** right now. HDMI and VGA versions are fully locked, and the DP version is in its **final mechanical fit optimization** so that all variants can share the same enclosure and production flow.

<p style="text-align:center;"><small><em>A quick look at KVM-GO’s hardware evolution.</em></small></p>



## 1. Circuit Board Status (DP)

* **HDMI + VGA:** finalized
* **DP:** final mechanical optimization (shortening board length to match HDMI/VGA)

This step is **purely mechanical / packaging related**, not a change in product direction or feature set.
The goal is to enable:

* one unified metal enclosure,
* simpler assembly,
* and more consistent, cost-controlled production.



## 2. Accessories Progress

* Type-C to Type-A black cables: **ordered**
* Screws: **ordered**
* Stickers: **ordered**
* Openterface Toolkit boxes: **ordered**
* User manual: **design in progress**
* Product boxes: **design in progress**

Accessory preparation is moving smoothly and in parallel with hardware validation.



## 3. Cable & Metal Parts

* HDMI + VGA metal shells: **ready**
* DP metal shell: **pending final DP board length**
* Orange USB 3.0 Type-C cables: **ready**

<p style="text-align:center;"><small><em>HDMI & VGA metal shells are ready. The DP shell will follow once the board length is locked for the unified enclosure.</em></small></p>



## 4. Certification & Compliance

We’re preparing materials and test planning for:

* **CE**
* **RoHS**
* **FCC**
* **OSHWA submission**

Certification testing is now in the preparation stage. We’ll share concrete milestones once lab schedules and results land.



## 5. Thermal Solution (Validation in Progress)

Because we’re packing high performance into a compact enclosure, thermal validation is being done carefully rather than rushed.

* CNC metal heatsink samples are under test
* Multiple suppliers are being evaluated to compare machining quality and consistency

<p style="text-align:center;"><small><em>Thermal tuning through stress testing and material comparisons to ensure long-term stability.</em></small></p>



## 6. Firmware / Software Readiness

Hardware progress continues alongside software validation to keep the out-of-box experience smooth.

* Host app builds are stable; ongoing bug fixes and UX polish continue
* Compatibility testing across **macOS / Windows / Linux** is ongoing
* **iPadOS support**: development is being accelerated for an iPad-compatible app

<p style="text-align:center;"><small><em>Current host app downloads for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.</em></small></p>



## 7. Electronic Components & PCBA

* Electronic components are being purchased and staged
* **Mass PCBA will start after compliance confirms the final configuration**

This is a normal production workflow and helps avoid rework while keeping manufacturing efficient.



## 8. Plastic Parts

* Orange cover: 3D printing profile tuning in progress
* Nylon black cover: **ordered**

<p style="text-align:center;"><small><em>Orange cover printing in progress while we tune for consistency and surface quality.</em></small></p>



## What’s Next

In the next update, we’ll share:

* DP final board length confirmation and enclosure fit check
* Certification progress and lab scheduling updates
* Final thermal solution decision (heatsink + interface material)

Thanks again for backing a small team building practical, open hardware.
We’ll keep updates **frequent, honest, and grounded in real progress**.
