The images above shows all connections between the [**KVM-Go**](/product/kvm-go), host computer, and target device.

- **Host Computer**: Requires the [Openterface App](/app) installed.  
- **Target Device**: No software and pre-config needed.
- **Video**: The built-in connector plugs directly into the target device, so you don’t need to carry or manage extra video cables.
