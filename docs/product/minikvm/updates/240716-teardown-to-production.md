# 2024-07-16 | From Teardown to Production: Weâ€™re Moving Forward!

Hey everyone,

Itâ€™s been a while since our crowdfunding campaign ended, and weâ€™ve got some fantastic updates to share with you. Weâ€™re excited to dive headfirst into the production phase of our Openterface Mini-KVM and keep you informed on our progress.

## Teardown 2024 Highlights

First of all, last monthâ€™s [Teardown 2024](https://x.com/TechxArtisan/status/1810619822948090092) hosted by [**Crowd Supply**](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024) in Portland was nothing short of amazing. It was fantastic to meet so many of our tech friends and backers in person at our demo table! Your kind words are a great encouragement and motivation for us. Here are some snaps from the event:

A big shoutout to Electromaker for featuring our product during the event! Check out our chat in this video:

## Production in Full Swing

Right now, weâ€™re busy **ordering parts and chips** like the CH9329 and CH340 as we gear up for production. Weâ€™re also submitting our Mini-KVM and cables for CE, RoHS, and UKCA certification testing. If all goes well, weâ€™ll start production at the factories soon. Our team is ensuring every step of the production line runs smoothly to deliver a top-notch product thatâ€™s both fun and reliable! Here are some snaps of the test reports for RoHS and CE for our orange Type-C cable:

Stay tuned, as weâ€™ll have more similar reports for our Mini-KVMs and other cables to ensure they all meet the required certification standards.

## OSHWA Certification

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce that our Openterface Mini-KVM is now officially **OSHWA** certified as fully open-source! ðŸ¥³ You can check out our certification here: [OSHWA UID CN000015](https://certification.oshwa.org/cn000015.html). We're committed to keeping both the software and hardware open-source, enabling tech lovers to explore the potential of USB KVM, contribute to its development, and build a vibrant community together.

## Hardware Update V1.9


Weâ€™ve just launched **hardware V1.9 with extra pins: VCC, GND, Target D+, Target D-, Host D+, Host D-** for even more hackable fun! These data pins are connected to the Target's and Host's USB hub. Now you can DIY extensions for Openterface â€” think ATX, network bridging, audio bypass, and more. What creative ideas do you have for hacking our Mini-KVM with these pins? Join our [Reddit](/reddit) or [Discord](/discord), share your thoughts and have a fun coding with us!

## Run Openterface on Pi & Team Up with uConsole

Weâ€™ve successfully **run our QT host app on a Pi environment**! Whatâ€™s even more exciting is how our Mini-KVM can team up with Clockworkâ€™s **uConsole** to turn it into a portable KVM tool. Itâ€™s super handy for plug-and-play and quick troubleshooting of any headless devices nearby.

## Development & Final Touches

Our dev team, led by Kevin, is working tirelessly to test and refine the code. Join our [Techxartisan's Discord](/discord) to hang out with our dev and beta team and stay updated on our progress. Meanwhile, Billy is handling all the paperwork and finalising the design for our product, packaging, and product manual. 

Hereâ€™s a sneak peek of our updated prints and labels for the aluminium case, showcased in [Kazubuâ€™s tweet](https://x.com/_kazubu/status/1803442407800971612) when Billy shared it with him in Tokyo, Japan:

## On Track for September

Weâ€™re currently right on schedule and working hard to get our Mini-KVMs into your hands by the end of September.

Weâ€™d love your help in spreading the word about our Mini-KVM. We hope it can benefit more tech enthusiasts and make tech life easier for anyone managing headless devices.

Thanks so much for all your support and enthusiasm. We couldn't have done it without you!

Cheers,  
Billy Wang  
Openterface Team
