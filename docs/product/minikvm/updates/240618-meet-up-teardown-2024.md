# 2024-06-18 | Meet Me in Portland This Weekend & Win a Mini-KVM from My Game Challenge!

Hey everyone! Weâ€™ve got some fantastic news to share!

### Big Thanks!
First off, I can't [thank you all](https://x.com/TechxArtisan/status/1801850068263178300) enough for your incredible support. Our crowdfunding campaign has absolutely smashed its goals on Jun 14, hitting **$248k** with the amazing support from over **1110 backers** and **Crowd Supply**.

This success has given us the chance to make the Mini-KVM even better! We couldnâ€™t have done it without youâ€”seriously, thank you from the bottom of our hearts! ðŸ§¡ We'll be working full throttle in production to ensure delivery to your hands soon!

### Fun Bet & My Flight to Portland!
So, hereâ€™s a fun story: As I mentioned in [this post](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/openterface-mini-kvm/updates/last-hours-to-back-and-mini-kvms-at-tech-frontlines), Kevin and I made a bet. If we could get 100 new backers in the final 36 hours, I would **fly to the US** for [Crowd Supply's Teardown 2024](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024). Well, guess what? We didnâ€™t just hit 100â€”we got 165 new backers! So, Iâ€™m super excited to announce that Iâ€™ll be attending Teardown 2024 in person on this Friday (June 21) and weekend.

### My Demo Table & Livestream
Teardown is Crowd Supplyâ€™s annual flagship event centered around all things hardware - featuring talks, demos, workshops, and more.

Teardown 2024 Lloyd Center Mall Portland, Oregon June 21-23, 2024

I'll have a demo table at the Teardown Event: [Check it out here!](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024/demo/openterface-mini-kvm-turn-your-laptop-as-a-kvm-console)

Any chance you're near the Portland area? It'd be fantastic to meet you at the event! Buy the [Teardown ticket](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024) now and hope to see you thereâ€”**come by and say hi**!

If you canâ€™t make it to the event, donâ€™t worry. You can always find me on our Discord and Subreddit during the conference. You can text or talk to me in real time, as I may be live-streaming all three days while I'm at the demo table, so join our community now and you wonâ€™t miss a thing.

### Game Challenge at Teardown
Now, for a bit of fun: Iâ€™m setting up **a video game competition** at Teardown 2024. Iâ€™ll be demoing how our Mini-KVM works with the portable computer, uConsole, which is basically a Raspberry Pi. Check out my X tweet [here](https://x.com/TechxArtisan/status/1802675690015424962) to see how Iâ€™ll set it up with the Mini-KVM.

I'm thinking of using games like Pac-Man, The King of Fighters '97, and Tetris for the game challenge. And hereâ€™s the kickerâ€”winners can snag a Mini-KVM from me right there! So, come and play a game with me to win!

### More to Come
As always, weâ€™re cooking up some exciting things, and I will have a super exciting announcement at Teardown! So stay tuned for more updates. I canâ€™t wait to see you at Teardown 2024!

Cheers,
