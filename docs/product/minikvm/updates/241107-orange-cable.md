# The Ship Has Sailed & Extra Cables Added for the Toolkit. Whatâ€™s Next?

Hello, Openterface community!

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce that our Openterface products have officially shipped. Theyâ€™re currently at the port in Shenzhen, ready to board a cargo ship bound for the US!

![cardboard boxs to Crowdsupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/fa1e/e8712da8-fb16-4947-9ce7-56c261c4fa1e/241107-s_jpg_gallery-lg.jpg)

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new:

## Fulfillment Preparations: Quality Checks and Packing

Before packing and shipping, we thoroughly tested each unit to ensure the highest quality, as we mentioned in previouse update: [DIY Challenge, Cool Prizes, and Production Nears the Finish Line!](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/openterface-mini-kvm/updates/diy-challenge-cool-prizes-and-production-nears-the-finish-line). Every cable was scrutinised for signal transmission stability using our Mini-KVM.

Now, letâ€™s talk about the newsâ€”both the bad and the good.

### BAD News: Some Orange Cables Didnâ€™t Meet Expectations Under Tough Conditions

Our Mini-KVM transmits video, audio, mouse/keyboard control, and USB data via a single Type-C cable. The cableâ€™s performance is critical for data stability, especially in challenging environments.

To simulate real-world interference, we wrapped the orange Type-C cable around an electric fan motor while running multiple computers nearby. This created a high level of electromagnetic interference (EMI), to evaluate our cablesâ€™ data transmission stability.

![Testing Setup](https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/582f/cf618b42-e6ea-41dc-9fc9-7c9f2443582f/241107-0_jpg_gallery-lg.jpg)
*A budget-friendly yet effective testing method.*

Check out [our video tweet](https://x.com/TechxArtisan/status/1856559677296816347) showcasing one of our performance tests for comparison.

Under these conditions, some orange cables struggled with signal loss, raising concerns about their reliability in complex environments such as data centres or during critical IT operations.

To address this, Kevin Peng, our tech director, developed a bespoke testing programme. This tool, allowing you to test the quality of your own USB cables, will soon be open-sourced with more updates later.

![Testing programme interface](https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/edad/3a30e668-b0e4-4a2d-ace3-446292d6edad/241107-1_jpg_md-xl.jpg)
*Our programme makes cable testing a breeze.*

While our orange cables, with its soft, silicone-like texture and attractive appearance, are great and are perfect for everyday use like fast charging and regular data transmits, they fall short in a heavy transmits work in tough conditions, like high EMI.

### GOOD News: Our Solution is Here

Weâ€™ve immediately sourced high-quality nylon USB 3.2 cables to include as an extra in the Toolkit versionâ€”**at no additional cost** to you. These durable cables come in three lengths in grey color: *1M (3.2 ft)*, *1.5M (4.9 ft)*, and *2M (6.5 ft)*. Youâ€™ll receive one randomly selected cable from these length options in your Toolkit version, ensuring you have a robust and reliable connection for your Mini-KVM.

In future Mini-KVM Toolkit versions, our orange cable for connecting to the host side of Mini-KVM will be upgraded to the nylon Type-C 3.2 cable, combining functionality, stability, and style.

![Custom Nylon Type-C cables](https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/1f6b/27fa6407-e058-4cf1-82f5-d788c8fa1f6b/241107-3_jpg_md-xl.jpg)

We hope you appreciate this decision and continue to rely on Openterface during critical moments on your tech frontlines.

## Shipping Schedule
When can you expect your Mini-KVM?
If everything goes smoothly with our shippment, our products should arrive at Crowd Supplyâ€™s **Mouser warehouse by mid-December**, then they will get our Openterface shipped out according to each orders accordingly.

- **For backers in the US**: thereâ€™s a small chance for delivery before Christmas, but this isnâ€™t guaranteed, since everything tends to slow down as the holiday gets closer.

- **For backers outside the US**: Delivery times will vary. Our best estimate is mid-January.

Hereâ€™s hoping for a smooth journey for our Openterface productsâ€”no seasickness, carsickness, or jet lag! ðŸ˜ƒ
