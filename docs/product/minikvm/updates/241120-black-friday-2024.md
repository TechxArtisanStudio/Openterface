Hey dear Openterface folks,

Exciting news‚Äîwe've launched **a new clothing line** at Openterface! Our collection features T-shirts and hoodies that embody the spirit of our community. They're not just clothes; they're a celebration of our shared values and the Openterface ethos.

What makes these designs even more special? Both the T-shirt and hoodie proudly feature the **technical line art of our Openterface mini-KVM**, which looks incredibly cool. Plus, we've highlighted our mini-KVM's **"Developer Mode"** text in the design‚Äîan idea we think is absolutely brilliant. When you put on our T-shirt or hoodie, it's not just about staying warm this winter; it's about stepping into super developer mode for all your coding and hacking sessions.

And if you're wondering how these look in real life, check out how our team's been wearing them in action! From staying cosy in **Developer Mode** while coding ([see tweet](https://x.com/TechxArtisan/status/1861611266705379346)), to a fun photoshoot with David Groom from **MAKE: Magazine** at the Shenzhen Maker Faire ([view photo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gcp8E32agAAEnl-?format=jpg&name=large)), we've been proudly showcasing our gear. We even got inspired by a talk from the legendary Eric Migicovsky of Pebble fame ([see post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/billy-wangrb_had-an-incredible-weekend-at-shenzhen-maker-activity-7264123680803233792-l7Mm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)) while demoing the Openterface Mini-KVM and connecting with tech friends ([see more](https://twitter.com/TechxArtisan/status/1858397377196965913), [and here](https://twitter.com/TechxArtisan/status/1858400923325726750)). These aren't just clothes‚Äîthey're conversation starters and a way to celebrate our community wherever we go!
