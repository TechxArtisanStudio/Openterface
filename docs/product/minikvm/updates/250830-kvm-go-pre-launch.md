# Say Hello to KVM-Go – the Next Ultra Portable Chapter in Your KVM adventure

We’re thrilled to announce the next evolution in your KVM-over-USB experience: **Openterface KVM-Go**, now available for [pre-launch signups](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/openterface-kvm-go)!

![keychain-kvm-go](https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/d0fd/3fe2afa6-051e-41e0-9f59-cbab8d7bd0fd/kvm-go-group-03_jpg_gallery-lg.jpg)

Building on the success of our flagship [Mini-KVM](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/openterface-mini-kvm) and the vibrant growth of our open-source community, KVM-Go pushes portability even further. Mini-KVM continues to shine as the flexible all-rounder, while KVM-Go is crafted for those who demand maximum convenience in the smallest possible form factor.

### What makes KVM-Go compelling?

* **Keychain ready, video-cable-free design**
  Built-in video connectors (HDMI, DisplayPort, or VGA) mean no more rummaging for video cables during urgent server rack interventions. Just plug in and go.

* **Compact yet powerful**
  Despite its tiny form factor, KVM-Go packs a strong spec boost:

  * **4K @ 60 Hz video output** support compared to Mini-KVM’s 1080p @ 30 Hz
  * HDMI and DisplayPort models feature a **USB 3.0** video processor for high performance, while the VGA model utilises USB 2.0 to maintain compatibility with legacy systems
  * Convenient **micro SD slot** for file transfers or bootable OS installation

  *Note: final case size and weight will be confirmed as we complete the design. We are targeting approximately 18 × 18 × 55 mm (about 25 g). The PCB design is already finalised and robust. For the VGA model, the case design is still in progress and will be slightly bigger than the HDMI and DP versions.*

* **Open source ethos, everywhere**
  As before, KVM-Go is fully open hardware and comes with open-source softwares, our [Openterface KVM](https://openterface.com/app/), supporting various OS, compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and Chrome browsers.

* **Zero setup on target devices**
  No drivers, no installation, just pure plug-and-play functionality, independent of network or configuration.

### What about pricing?

We want KVM-Go to remain accessible, while upholding the quality and innovation you expect from us. Our aim is to price KVM-Go in a similar range to the flagship Mini-KVM, with only a modest increase to account for its upgraded specs and ultra-compact design. The exact price isn’t set yet, as it depends on production scale and community interest, so your early support truly makes a difference.

**Why your early support matters:**

* **Production planning made easier** – Understanding demand helps us optimise manufacturing processes and reduce costs through economies of scale.
* **Wallet-friendly pricing** – More supporters mean better pricing for everyone through optimised production runs.
* **Open hardware sustainability** – Developing and manufacturing open-source hardware is not easy or cheap, but we're committed, with even more exciting plans on our roadmap, and your support makes it possible.
* **Community-driven development** – Your feedback and early adoption help us refine the product before full-scale production.

### Small-batch production & Beta testing program

In September, we will begin small-batch production of three versions in sequence: **HDMI**, **DisplayPort**, and **VGA**. Each will undergo thorough testing and refinement before we scale up production further.

We are excited to welcome both longtime supporters and newcomers to apply for our **exclusive beta test programme** for this small batch. Participation slots are extremely limited, so we cannot accommodate everyone. If you have unique use cases or creative ideas that could help us refine KVM-Go’s reliability and usability, we would love to know! Please share your feedback through [this Google form](https://forms.gle/yaS1F5E5MSo8DWNZ6).

Please know that I read every comment and suggestion with care. Your feedback is crucial in helping us shape and improve this open-source project. If you are chosen for the early beta test team, I will reach out to you directly via email.
