### Other Apps

While they're lower priorities, they're definitely in the pipeline. We're also exploring ChromeOS support and the possibility of getting the mini-KVM working on iPads with M series chips. Join the discussion in our community if you have any insights!

## Hardware Open Source NOW!

We've given our hardware repository a major upgrade! It's now packed with **datasheets, 3D models, BOM, and schematics** â€“ everything you need to get hands-on with our gadget.

Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, we want your feedback and wild suggestions! And for you makers out there, why not try building our mini-KVM from scratch? Tweak our code, make it your own, and show us what you've got!

## Even Better Accessories

### NEW 1.5m Orange Type-C Cable with Converter

![type-c-cable-v2-plugged-old-mac](https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/9871/2f6f967e-b9ea-4b48-b5dd-da135fb29871/type-c-cable-v2-plugged-old-mac_jpg_md-xl.jpg)

Remember our [stylish orange Type-C cable](/blog/from-development-to-your-hands--behind-the-scenes-/#upgrading-toolkit-accessories) with the lovely silicone feel? We've received the first samples, and they look amazing! These cables support **240W fast charging** (Voltage DC50V, Current 5A, Power 240W) and work perfectly with our mini-KVMs. Big thanks to our manufacturer and our backers for making this happen!

### Upgraded Toolkit Bag

With the new handy attached adapter for our 1.5m Type-C cable and [1m long VGA-to-HDMI cable update](/blog/-upgrade-on-vga-to-hdmi-cable-as-a-free-bonus-/), we believe it is necessary to increase the size of our toolkit bag to 16 cm L x 10 cm W x 3.8 cm H, providing a bit more space!

![beta-round2-toolkit](https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/0f20/4aed395b-dbef-4670-b340-403ee8e30f20/beta-round2-toolkit_jpg_md-xl.jpg)

### Packaging Experiments

We're experimenting with different designs for our outer packaging boxes â€“ colorful, grey, black, and more. We're leaning towards the colorful design, but we want your feedback!

![toolkit-boxes-showcase.jpg](https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/b54b/a041e188-b6ea-4f49-a550-46bc9565b54b/toolkit-boxes-showcase_jpg_gallery-lg.jpg)

Check out the details of our beta toolkit sent to our beta team [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Openterface_miniKVM/comments/1d40atr/tactical_reinforcements_round_2_are_on_their_way/). Let us know what you think! Just a heads-up, this packaging design isn't final. We may still need to adjust the box size and add essential details like the CE mark and other required info.

## Last Chance to Back Us!
