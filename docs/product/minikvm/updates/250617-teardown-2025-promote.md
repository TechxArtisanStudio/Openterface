# Teardown 2025: We’re Coming Back to Portland!

Hi, everyone! While our tech wizard Kevin Peng has been pulling late nights, jumper wires in his hair and heat-shrink tubing scattered across his desk, he’s been preparing something seriously cool. Why? Because our man with the megaphone, Billy Wang, is getting ready to show it all off at Teardown 2025! We can't wait to share what we’ve been cooking up, and we think you’ll love it too.

If you’ve never been, think of it as a playground for hackers and makers where nothing is sacred, like everything gets pulled apart, studied, and put back better (or at least crazier). You definitely want to keep an eye on this. Click the image below to visit the event page: https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2025

### The QT App Keeps Evolving because You Keep Asking

You know how we never stop tweaking, improving, and pushing boundaries? Well, that spirit is alive and kicking in our latest work on the Openterface QT. Whether you’re on Windows, macOS, or Linux, we’re hustling behind the scenes to keep it sharper, smoother, and more powerful than ever. Curious to see all those cool visual improvements? Go ahead, give it a hard click right here: <https://github.com/TechxArtisanStudio/Openterface_QT>

So that’s the scoop, friend.

We’re building, breaking, improving, and sharing every step of the way, because this community isn’t just about tech. It’s a family of makers and dreamers. Stay curious. Keep tinkering. And we’ll catch you in the next update.

Product Lead, Openterface
