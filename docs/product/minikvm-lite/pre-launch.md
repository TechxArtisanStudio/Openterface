# Lite Series Pre-Launch & Waiting List

Hey there, tech enthusiasts!

Time flies, right? Over the past half year, we've been deep in the trenches refining our [host apps](/app) for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android. We thought it would be a smooth ride, but oh boy... software development had other ideas. One feature turned into another, then came the endless testing loops. But hey, we’re still in the game and making steady progress.

Now let’s switch gears and talk about something new. While we’ve been busy with the apps, we took a moment to zoom out and look at the bigger picture. Our goal is still the same: to help IT pros, makers, and tech lovers like you get the job done fast, especially when you're working with headless devices in unpredictable setups, where time is tight and network access might be shaky.

So, what’s next?

## Meet the Openterface Lite Series

The Openterface Mini-KVM is already a handy, portable KVM-over-USB tool. But we kept asking ourselves: how can we make it even smaller and easier to carry?

Simple answer: **drop the extra video cable.**

Let’s be real. When you're in a fire-fighting situation and can't find the right cable, it's annoying. That’s why we decided to trade a bit of flexibility for even more portability. And boom, the **Openterface Lite Series** was born. It’s all about saving space and getting you connected faster.

## What We’re Cooking Up

We’re super excited to show you the first member of the Lite family:

- **Openterface Lite HDMI Male** — A compact, all-in-one HDMI solution you can plug straight in.

And we're not stopping there. Coming up next:

- **Openterface Lite VGA Male** — For those of you still dealing with trusty old legacy systems.

We might also explore micro-HDMI, mini-HDMI, and even DisplayPort versions. Not top priority right now, but if you need a specific version, let us know. Seriously, we’re listening.

## Stay in the Loop & Your Thoughts

Right now we’re in the pre-launch phase. Things are still moving around. We’re working on refining the PCB and finalizing the case design. If you want to follow along and help shape this project, join our waiting list.

**Just drop your email in this** [Google Form](https://forms.gle/yaS1F5E5MSo8DWNZ6) and you’ll get updates, sneak peeks, and early access.

As always, we love hearing your thoughts. What do you think? What features would you like to see? Your feedback helps us build something better.

And if your ideas stand out, once our prototype is ready for beta testing, we’ll invite some of you awesome folks to join our beta team and **become our bug hunters or early previewers**.

## Cost & Price

To be honest, we don’t have a clear price yet. With today’s crazy tariff and shipping situations, it’s hard to pin things down. But here’s the deal: **the more people who get on board early, the easier it is for us to plan production and keep costs under control.** So if you want the price to be wallet-friendly, help us spread the word and making it a reality!

Thanks for being awesome!
