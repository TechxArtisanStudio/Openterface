## General

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } What is KeyMod Series?**

KeyMod Series is a compact USB + Bluetooth HID (keyboard and mouse) emulator that turns your phone into a portable keyboard and trackpad. Use it to control devices that need keyboard/mouse input—kiosks, smart TVs, set top boxes, outdoor displays—without carrying a full keyboard.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } What platforms does the KeyMod Series app support?**

The KeyMod Series controller app focuses on **Android** , **IOS** and **iPadOS**. We are also expanding desktop control with **Windows and macOS** software in our broader Openterface ecosystem.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Does the target device need any software?**

No. KeyMod Series emulates a standard USB keyboard and mouse. The target device recognizes it as plug-and-play HID hardware—no drivers or software installation required.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } Is KeyMod Series open source?**

Yes. KeyMod Series is open hardware and open software. We will publish schematics, PCB files, firmware, software, and BOM as the project evolves.

## Pre-Launch

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } When will KeyMod Series launch?**

KeyMod Series is in pre-launch development. Subscribe on the [product page](/product/keymod/) for launch notifications and updates.

**:material-chat-question:{ .faq } How is KeyMod Series related to Mini-KVM and KVM-Go?**

KeyMod Series uses the proven HID core from Openterface Mini-KVM. It shares the same hardware-based keyboard and mouse emulation approach but is designed for a different use case: turning your phone into a portable keyboard/trackpad for local device control, rather than KVM-over-USB video capture.
