# **Features & Specifications** | Openterface KeyMod

## Pre-Launch Status

KeyMod is currently in pre-launch development. We're refining the hardware and software. Subscribe on the [product page](/product/keymod/) to stay updated on progress and launch notifications.

> **Note:** Features, specifications, and design are still subject to change as development continues.

## Product Variants

- **2-in-1 Connector Version** — Combined USB A + USB C plug design for broad compatibility with laptops, tablets, and phones
- **USB C Version** — Dedicated USB C plug for modern devices and clean cable management

## Core Features

### **Phone as Keyboard and Trackpad**

KeyMod turns your phone into a portable keyboard and trackpad console. Use it when a full keyboard and mouse are not available, or when you want a faster workflow than switching devices. Ideal for outdoor display computers, LED signage players, kiosks, smart TVs, and set top boxes.

### **Dual Connection: USB + Bluetooth**

- **USB** — Plug-and-play wired connection for reliable, low-latency input
- **Bluetooth** — Cable-free setup when the scenario allows; keep your setup light and portable

KeyMod is built for practical everyday local device control, not as a remote desktop replacement.

### **Open Source Mobile App**

With our open source mobile app, you can:

- Build custom input profiles
- Launch macros and configure hotkeys
- Extend to advanced modes: keypad and gamepad
- Create workflow shortcuts

The KeyMod controller app focuses on **Android and iPadOS**. We are also expanding desktop control with **Windows and macOS** software in our broader Openterface ecosystem.

### **Virtual Game Controller**

KeyMod can act as a virtual game controller with familiar layouts:

- **Xbox layout**
- **PlayStation layout**
- **NES layout**

### **Programmable Hardware Buttons**

KeyMod includes programmable hardware buttons for on-device actions like quick triggers and simple macro-style workflows. This capability is still experimental and will be refined through prototyping, testing, and community feedback.

### **True Hardware HID**

Built on the proven HID core from Openterface Mini-KVM. Hardware-based keyboard and mouse emulation—no software installation required on the target device.

### **Open Source**

KeyMod is open hardware and open software. We will publish schematics, PCB files, firmware, software, and BOM as the project evolves. [Join our community](/discord) to contribute and stay updated.
