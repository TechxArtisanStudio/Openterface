## Primary Use Cases

### **Outdoor Display Computers**

Control display computers in outdoor installations without carrying a keyboard. KeyMod connects your phone to the display PC for configuration, troubleshooting, or content updates.

### **LED Signage Players**

Manage LED signage players and controllers on-site. Plug KeyMod in, use your phone as the keyboard, and make changes without hunting for a keyboard.
