# **Openterface KVM-GO: Beta Review Guide**

Hey there!

Thanks again for joining our beta program. We’re genuinely excited to have you trying out the **KVM-GO** with our early access group. This little thing is basically a keychain-sized KVM that lets you connect to headless devices without any of the usual headaches.

## **What Makes KVM-GO Cool**

The **KVM-GO** (HDMI, DP, and VGA versions) is tiny enough to carry on a keychain, but way more capable than our previous Mini-KVM. You don’t need monitors, networks, or complicated setup steps. Just plug it in and it works. Super handy for IT folks, server admins, and anyone who deals with headless devices.

**Your audience will probably appreciate that it:**

* Is *seriously* tiny and super portable
* Works the moment you plug it in with just USB
* Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, even iPadOS
* Gives full BIOS access for server and troubleshooting work
* Supports 4K video, which is kinda wild for the size

## **What We’re Hoping For**

We want your honest take. Really. If something feels off, let us know. If you love it, we’d love to hear that too. Since this is still beta, your feedback truly shapes the final product.

**For your content, feel free to:**

* Use whatever format fits your style: video, written review, social posts
* Test it in the kinds of situations your audience would relate to
* Try it with different host/target devices and operating systems
* Pay attention to our new features, such as its new design from, 4K and portability

**About the schedule:**

* Take your time. Two to four weeks is totally fine.
* Publish whenever you feel your review is ready.
* Our campaign is running right now (until December 30), but honestly… a thoughtful review is always more valuable to us than a rushed one.

**When you do publish:**

* Just be yourself and share your real experience
