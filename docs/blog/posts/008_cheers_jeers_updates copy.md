Hey folks! 🎉 Glad to have you here!

Guess what? We're deep in the trenches crafting something pretty cool – our Openterface mini-KVM! This nifty gadget is a portable KVM-over-USB that lets you control another computer right from your laptop. Neat, huh? 🚀

I've been chatting about it over in the [homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) community with these two posts: [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1acdfwt/crafting_a_minikvm_prototype_in_a_black_aluminium/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1ahwrl4/trying_out_my_minikvm_on_ubuntu_any_feedback/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I also asked for opinion on improving its labels in [design](https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/1aht6m3/new_look_for_our_minikvm_what_do_you_think/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) community.

Boy, did it stir up a storm! 🌪️ Some folks were scratching their heads, wondering what on earth this little KVM-over-USB does, while others thought it might just be another piece of tech clutter. But then, there were those who got it in a heartbeat and were all in, showering us with love and some really insightful feedback. 🥰

I'm super grateful for every bit of chatter - good, bad, and everything in between. It's been incredibly valuable and has given me loads to ponder on improving and refining our plans. It truly means a lot and encouraging! 🌟

🤔 Based on your questions and feedback, we've spruced up our [FAQ page](https://openterface.com/faq/) on the product website. I know that our product could be a bit difficult to understand what is it as people doesn't have experience of KVM, VNC, VLC, sort of things. I will make some more demo videos, which shall be much easier to present our mini-KVM's capabilities for certain use cases.

Well, please take a look and let us know what you think. If something's not quite right or if you fancy a chat about it, drop me a message! Your insights are gold. ✨

Thanks a million for your support, you tech aficionados! Whether you're a critic or a cheerleader, you're what keeps us going. Let's keep the conversation rolling! 💌

Catch ya later! 🌈
