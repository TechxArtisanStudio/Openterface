# Meet Me in Portland This Weekend & Win a Mini-KVM from My Game Challenge!

Hey everyone! We’ve got some fantastic news to share!

### Big Thanks!
First off, I can't [thank you all](https://x.com/TechxArtisan/status/1801850068263178300) enough for your incredible support. Our crowdfunding campaign has absolutely smashed its goals on Jun 14, hitting **$248k** with the amazing support from over **1110 backers** and **Crowd Supply**.

This success has given us the chance to make the Mini-KVM even better! We couldn’t have done it without you—seriously, thank you from the bottom of our hearts! 🧡 We'll be working full throttle in production to ensure delivery to your hands soon!

### Fun Bet & My Flight to Portland!
So, here’s a fun story: As I mentioned in [this post](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/openterface-mini-kvm/updates/last-hours-to-back-and-mini-kvms-at-tech-frontlines), Kevin and I made a bet. If we could get 100 new backers in the final 36 hours, I would **fly to the US** for [Crowd Supply's Teardown 2024](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024). Well, guess what? We didn’t just hit 100—we got 165 new backers! So, I’m super excited to announce that I’ll be attending Teardown 2024 in person on this Friday (June 21) and weekend.

### My Demo Table & Livestream
Teardown is Crowd Supply’s annual flagship event centered around all things hardware - featuring talks, demos, workshops, and more.

Teardown 2024 Lloyd Center Mall Portland, Oregon June 21-23, 2024

I'll have a demo table at the Teardown Event: [Check it out here!](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024/demo/openterface-mini-kvm-turn-your-laptop-as-a-kvm-console)

Any chance you're near the Portland area? It'd be fantastic to meet you at the event! Buy the [Teardown ticket](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024) now and hope to see you there—**come by and say hi**!

If you can’t make it to the event, don’t worry. You can always find me on our Discord and Subreddit during the conference. You can text or talk to me in real time, as I may be live-streaming all three days while I'm at the demo table, so join our community now and you won’t miss a thing.

### Game Challenge at Teardown
Now, for a bit of fun: I’m setting up **a video game competition** at Teardown 2024. I’ll be demoing how our Mini-KVM works with the portable computer, uConsole, which is basically a Raspberry Pi. Check out my X tweet [here](https://x.com/TechxArtisan/status/1802675690015424962) to see how I’ll set it up with the Mini-KVM.

I'm thinking of using games like Pac-Man, The King of Fighters '97, and Tetris for the game challenge. And here’s the kicker—winners can snag a Mini-KVM from me right there! So, come and play a game with me to win!

### More to Come
As always, we’re cooking up some exciting things, and I will have a super exciting announcement at Teardown! So stay tuned for more updates. I can’t wait to see you at Teardown 2024!

Cheers,
