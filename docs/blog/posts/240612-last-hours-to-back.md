## Upcoming Teardown 2024 & A Fun Bet

As many of you have seen on the Crowd Supply main page, the upcoming **Teardown 2024 event** is generating a lot of excitement. I’m eager to attend in person and meet our amazing backers there!

Here's **a fun bet** we have going on in our team: 

Currently, we have around 950 backers for our project. Kevin Peng, our technical director, and I have a wager. If we manage to **get 100 more backers** in the final hours, my travel expenses for the trip to Portland will be covered by our studio. If not, I'll have to foot the bill myself, which means a couple of thousand bucks out of my own pocket!

So, I’m calling on all our subscribers and new friends of the Openterface Mini-KVM to help us push through these final hours. Let's hit 1050+ backers and make this trip happen!

Most importantly, please **help spread the word** about our campaign coming to an end. We're committed to building this handy device and ensuring it’s delivered to you in top-notch quality.

We've poured our hearts into this project over the past 8 months. You can see all our efforts in the updates below and check out our history posts on our subreddit [r/Openterface_miniKVM](/reddit):
