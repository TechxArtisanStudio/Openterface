I hope this message finds you all in good spirits!

I'm thrilled to share a milestone achievement with you today: **Our macOS host application for Openterface mini-KVM is now available on the Apple App Store!**

However, there's a unique twist! As of now, you might not be able to fully experience the app without an Openterface mini-KVM device. This brings us to an exciting opportunity: **We are inviting our cherished community members to become beta testers!** 🌟

As a tester, you'll not only gain early access to our groundbreaking application but will also receive an Openterface mini-KVM, on the house! We're inviting you to test our app and device in real-world scenarios: your work or hobby projects.

🕵️ **Your mission?** To identify any bugs 🐞 that need addressing, suggest features 🚀 that could enhance your experience, and much more. This is your chance to directly influence the development of a product designed to streamline your digital life. Your contributions will not only be appreciated but also acknowledged in our thank-you list 📜 later. Please note, the opportunity to become a beta tester is limited due to the unique and exclusive nature of this early access phase.

📝 **Interested?** If you're eager to embark on this pioneering journey with us, simply express your interest by replying to this post and completing [the application form](https://forms.gle/gNKpnvrvwnZNUJbq5).

🗓 **Deadline for This Round**: the deadline to express interest and submit your application for this first round of beta testing is **29th March**, New York time. We will announce the lucky individuals selected as our beta testers right here in this post on 1st April. Don't miss this unique opportunity to shape the future of technology with us.

⏳ **What's Next?** This is just the first round of invitations for beta testers. If you don't make it this time, don't lose hope! Stay tuned for future rounds.

📣 **A Call to Action!** Beyond testing, we have another favour to ask. Help us spread the word about the Openterface mini-KVM and its upcoming crowdfunding campaign. Your support could be the wind beneath our wings, propelling this product into existence more swiftly and making it more affordable. Every share, every conversation helps us gain the momentum we need.

We're looking forward to your support! If you haven't subscribed to our [Crowd Supply's Pre-launch page](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/openterface-mini-kvm) yet, please do so and consider becoming our backer in the upcoming crowdfunding campaign. Can't wait to embark on this adventure with you! ❤️

Best,
