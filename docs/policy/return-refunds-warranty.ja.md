# Return, Refunds and Warranty Policy

## Returns

Openterface provides options for returns and exchanges in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

### Damage in Shipment

Should your product arrive with damage incurred during shipment, we request you to inform us via email at [info@techxartisan.com](mailto:info@techxartisan.com) within two business days of receipt. Your email should detail the damages and, where possible, include photographic evidence. This assists us greatly in ensuring our products are properly packaged and transported. We will organize replacements for the damaged products.

### Exchanges

If you are unsatisfied with your purchase for any reason, we offer the facility to return items in exchange for store credit. For a return to be accepted, items must adhere to the criteria outlined in the section [Important Conditions for Return]. Please initiate exchanges within 15 days following delivery. Note that Openterface ==does not cover the costs of return postage and customs tax.==

### Important Conditions for Return

Upon receiving the returned product, it will undergo an inspection. To ensure a smooth return process, please meet the following conditions:

- The product must be in its original, undamaged state.
- Notification of the product's return must be given to us within 15 business days.
- The return package should contain all items that were included in the original purchase, such as price tags, labels, original packaging, freebies, accessories, invoices, warranty cards, and other documentation.
- It is acknowledged and agreed that Openterface retains the discretion to determine if a product is in a saleable condition. Items deemed unsaleable will be discarded and no store credit or exchange will be issued for these items.

## Refunds

Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you of the receipt of your returned item. If the product is returned in an undamaged state, we will process the refund within five working days.

## Warranty

This warranty policy confers specific legal rights upon you. Additionally, depending on your location—be it a particular state, province, or country—you may have other rights. 

Openterface, as governed by law, respects your rights and does not seek to exclude, limit, or suspend any rights you possess, particularly those arising from nonconformity with a sales contract. To fully understand your rights, it's advisable to refer to the laws of your state, province, or country.

### Scope of this Warranty

The benefits provided by this Openterface warranty are in addition to, and do not detract from, any rights and remedies you may have under law in connection to the goods and services under warranty. This warranty is applicable to any Openterface products purchased from an authorised Openterface reseller or directly via www.openterface.com.

- Our policy limits warranties and services to products bought either directly from Openterface or an authorised Openterface reseller, and requires accompanying proof of purchase. If your Openterface product was bought from an unauthorised reseller, or if its original factory serial number is missing, defaced, or altered, this warranty becomes invalid.
- Be aware that some websites and dealers may falsely claim to be authorised Openterface resellers. Products bought through these sources are not covered by an Openterface warranty. These products may be counterfeit, used, defective, or unsuitable for use in your country. Ensure your protection and the integrity of your Openterface product by buying only from authorised resellers. For information on authorised resellers, please visit our website.

### Warranty Coverage

- Openterface guarantees its products, in their original packaging, against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.
- All Openterface limited warranties commence from the date of purchase. KEEP YOUR RECEIPT AS PROOF OF PURCHASE. The duration of the Openterface limited hardware warranty is typically 6 months from the date of purchase, though this may vary for different Openterface products.
- All Openterface warranties, including any statutory guarantees or non-excludable statutory warranties, are valid solely during the period the product is owned by the original purchaser. The 'original purchaser' is defined as the first buyer of the product from Openterface or an authorised reseller. Openterface limited warranties, including any lifetime warranties, are non-transferable.
- The warranty does not cover scenarios outside normal use, such as theft, accidents, misuse, abuse, water damage, or use of the product in conditions outside its specified operational climate.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, this warranty and any implied warranties constitute your sole and exclusive warranties, superseding all other warranties or conditions, whether express or implied. Some jurisdictions may not allow limitations on the duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply in your case.
