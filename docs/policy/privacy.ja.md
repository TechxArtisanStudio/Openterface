# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the “Openterface” mini-KVM device and its associated macOS application (collectively, the “Service”), developed and operated by Guangzhou Billio Tech. Co., Ltd. By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please refrain from using any products and services offered.

## **Data Collection and Use**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our Service does not collect, store, or transfer any personal data at any stage in using our app. For the effective operation of our Service - controlling your computer remotely through the Openterface device and app, we require access to certain types of non-personal data:

1. **Camera Access**: We require camera permissions to capture the video feed from your remotely connected computer. This is essential for displaying the feed on your device through the Openterface application.
2. **Keyboard and Mouse Event Data**: To enable remote control functionalities, we need permissions to listen to local keyboard and mouse events. This data is used solely to convert these events into control signals for the target device connected through our hardware.

Please note that the above-mentioned data is considered non-personal as it does not directly identify you as an individual. The permissions we request are necessary solely to enable core functionality. Data is also never stored or transferred outside your device.

## **Security**

With no collection or retention of user data at any point, protecting user data via security measures is not applicable in our case. Our app presents no privacy risks inherent in its intended functionality.

## **Disclaimer**

The Service may become open source in the future for transparency and community supervision. As a result, various versions of the app and device may be created and modified by third parties.This would enable anyone to inspect the code and build versions themselves, as well as modify for custom use cases. We will not be responsible for what individuals or organizations may build from modified code and hardware.  It is the user's responsibility to verify the source of the application. We strongly recommend downloading the app from our official website openterface.com and well-known, reliable certified app platform platforms for safety and reliability.
