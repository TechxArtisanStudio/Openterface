# Privacy Policy

**(Version 2 – February 2026)**

This Privacy Policy applies to the Openterface website, Openterface hardware devices, and their associated applications (collectively, the "Service"), developed and operated by **TechxArtisan Limited** ("TechxArtisan"). Openterface is a brand of TechxArtisan.

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please refrain from using the Service.

## Information Collected Through the Website

When you interact with the Openterface website, we may collect information you voluntarily provide:

- **Contact forms** — Name, email address, and any message you submit when contacting us.
- **Support email** — When you email us (e.g., at info@techxartisan.com) for support, we receive and process the content of your message and any information you include.
- **Newsletter subscription** — Email address and any preferences you provide when subscribing to our newsletter.
- **Website analytics (with consent)** — When you visit our website and accept our cookie consent, we use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to collect information about your visit, such as how you found us, which pages you view, which buttons or links you click, and general traffic data (e.g., device type, browser, approximate location). This helps us understand how visitors use our site and improve it. GA4 data is processed by Google according to their privacy policy. You can withdraw consent at any time via our cookie settings or your browser settings.

This information is used solely to respond to your inquiries, provide support, send newsletters as requested, or (for analytics) to improve our website. We do not use it for marketing beyond what you have opted into, and we do not share it with third parties for their marketing purposes.

## Data Collection and Use

TechxArtisan is committed to protecting user privacy. The Service is designed to operate **offline-first** and does **not collect, store, transmit, or process user data in the background**.

The Service does **not** require user accounts, cloud connectivity, analytics, or advertising services.

### Core Functionality Permissions

To provide the intended functionality of the Service—displaying video output from and controlling a connected target device—the application requires access to the following:

1. **Camera Access**
   Used solely to capture and display the video feed from the connected target system via Openterface hardware.

2. **Keyboard and Mouse Input Access**
   Used solely to convert local input events into control signals sent to the connected target device.

All such data is processed **locally and transiently on the user's device only**, solely for real-time operation. This information is **not stored, logged, analyzed, or transmitted** by TechxArtisan.

## Diagnostic Information (User-Initiated)

The Service includes an **optional self-diagnostic tool** to assist users in identifying hardware, firmware, or connection issues.

When explicitly initiated by the user, the diagnostic tool generates a diagnostic log **locally** on the user's device. This log may include technical information such as:

- Openterface device firmware version
- Application name and version
- Operating system type and version
- Basic hardware environment and USB / HID / camera connection status

The diagnostic information is intended solely for troubleshooting purposes.

### User Control and Consent

- Diagnostic logs are **not transmitted automatically**.
- The Service may prepare a **draft email** containing the diagnostic log.
- **The user must manually review and explicitly choose to send the email**.

TechxArtisan receives diagnostic information **only if and when the user voluntarily sends it** as part of a support request.

While diagnostic logs are not intended to include personal data, some system configuration details may be considered technical information related to the user's device. Such information is processed **only with the user's explicit action** and **only to diagnose and resolve reported issues**.

## Third-Party Services

The Service does **not** integrate with third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, tracking SDKs, or cloud data services. No user data is shared with third parties.

### Purchases Through Third-Party Sellers

Openterface products may be purchased through different channels, including the Openterface official website, authorized platforms (e.g., Crowd Supply, Mouser Electronics), and other authorized resellers.

When you purchase through a third-party platform or reseller, your personal data (billing, shipping, payment information) is collected and processed by that seller according to their privacy policy. This Privacy Policy applies to information you provide directly to Openterface (e.g., through our website, support email, or direct purchases). For purchases made through third-party sellers, please refer to the seller's privacy policy.

## Security

The Service is designed to minimize data exposure by avoiding background data collection and automatic transmission.

Permissions such as camera access and input monitoring are used **strictly for their stated functionality** and remain under the user's control via the operating system's permission settings at all times.

Any diagnostic information voluntarily provided to TechxArtisan through user-initiated support communication is used solely to respond to the reported issue and is not retained longer than necessary for support purposes.

## Open-Source and Third-Party Modifications

Parts of the Service may become open source to promote transparency and community collaboration. As a result, third parties may create modified versions of the software or hardware.

TechxArtisan is **not responsible** for the privacy practices, security, or behavior of third-party builds or modified versions. Users are responsible for verifying the source of the software they install.

We strongly recommend downloading the Service only from the official Openterface website ([https://openterface.com](https://openterface.com)) or trusted, certified application platforms.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Service, legal requirements, or operational practices. Any updates will be posted clearly on this page. Continued use of the Service after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.

## Agreement to Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy forms an integral part of the Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please do not use the Service.

## Language and Prevailing Version

This policy is written in English. If this policy is translated into other languages and there is any inconsistency or conflict between the English version and any translated version, the English version shall prevail and be the controlling version.

## Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
