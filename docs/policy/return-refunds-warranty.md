# Return, Refund, and Warranty Policy

**(Version 2 – February 2026)**

This policy applies to Openterface products, including Mini-KVM, KVM-GO, etc. Please read carefully, as returns, refunds, and warranty handling depend on where you purchased the product.

## Language and Prevailing Version

This policy is written in English. If this policy is translated into other languages and there is any inconsistency or conflict between the English version and any translated version, the English version shall prevail and be the controlling version.

## 1. Purchase Channel Matters

Openterface products may be purchased through different channels, including but not limited to:

- Openterface official website
- Authorized platforms (e.g. Crowd Supply, Mouser Electronics)
- Other authorized resellers

- **Refunds** are always processed by the original seller.
- **Replacement support** is provided directly by Openterface, subject to the conditions below.

## 2. Replacement (Primary Resolution)

If your Openterface product has a confirmed hardware defect or persistent functional issues under normal use (for example, unstable keyboard or mouse control), Openterface offers replacement as the primary resolution, regardless of purchase channel.

### Replacement Process

1. Contact Openterface support and follow the requested diagnostic steps (such as software self-checks, logs, or setup confirmation).
2. Once a hardware defect is confirmed, Openterface will offer a replacement unit.
3. In most cases, return of the defective unit is not required, unless explicitly requested by Openterface.
4. Replacement units are shipped by Openterface to restore normal functionality as quickly as possible.

## 3. Replacement and Refund Exclusivity

Replacement and refund are mutually exclusive resolutions.

- Customers may choose either replacement or refund, depending on eligibility and purchase channel.
- Once a replacement is confirmed and shipped, the order is no longer eligible for a refund.
- If a customer prefers a refund, they must contact the original seller before confirming replacement.
- This policy exists to prevent duplicate compensation and to ensure fair and consistent handling for all customers.

## 4. Refunds and Returns

### Refund Handling

- Openterface does not process refunds directly.
- If you purchased through Crowd Supply, Mouser, or another reseller, all refunds and return labels must be requested through that seller, according to their policies and timelines.
- Openterface may provide reasonable documentation (for example, confirmation of a hardware defect) to support a refund request.
- Refund approval, timing, and payment are solely determined by the seller.

### Returns for Refund

Any physical return of products for refund purposes is governed by the seller's return policy, including requirements related to:

- Return authorization
- Shipping method and address
- Customs duties or taxes, if applicable

## 5. Shipping Damage

If your product arrives damaged:

- For products shipped by a platform or reseller, please contact the seller's support team first, as they manage shipping and carrier claims.
- Openterface may assist with troubleshooting or documentation if needed.

## 6. Warranty

### Warranty Coverage

- Openterface warrants its products against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.
- **Warranty period:** 6 months from the date of purchase, unless otherwise stated.
- Warranty applies only to the original purchaser.
- Proof of purchase from Openterface or an authorized reseller is required.

### What Is Covered

- Manufacturing defects
- Hardware failures under normal operating conditions

### What Is Not Covered

- Damage due to misuse, accident, modification, water exposure, or operation outside specified environmental conditions
- Products purchased from unauthorized sellers

This warranty is provided in addition to any non‑excludable rights you may have under applicable law.

## 7. Authorized Resellers

Warranty and replacement support apply only to products purchased from Openterface or authorized resellers.

Openterface is not responsible for products purchased from unauthorized sources, which may be counterfeit, used, or defective.

## 8. Important Notes

- Replacement is the preferred and fastest resolution for confirmed hardware defects.
- Refunds must follow the original purchase channel.
- Shipping costs, duties, and taxes may vary by region and seller policy.
- Openterface reserves the right to assess cases individually to prevent abuse of replacement or warranty services.
